This is the project for COT5405 SP18.

Type make in the Terminal and follow the instructions.

All the tasks work on some random cases I build, however, task2 and task4 cannot get the correct results
in some samples which have the large size. I use debug to trace the variables in those random cases built on my own and is pretty sure each algorithm works properly. I could not debug on those sample cases with large size.
